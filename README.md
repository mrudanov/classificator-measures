### Small Python3 script to measure multi-class classifier performance

This script helps me to identify how good facial recognizer in [Mephi22](https://github.com/mrudanov/Mephi22) mobile app works.
It plots multi- and single-class [confusion matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) (error matrices) and calculates basic rates, such as:
* Error rate
* Accuracy
* Sensitivity
* Specificity
* Precision
* Fall-out
* F1-score
* Cohen's Kappa
